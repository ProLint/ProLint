        ProLint is a complete webserver that takes input data, analyses the underlying interaction and
        visualizes the results, without requiring any input from the user. ProLint is also a webservice in that
        it can store results and allow users world-wide to interact with the data regardless of their knowledge of
        Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations or coding experience. Hosting and sharing of data files is done free
        of charge. Finally, ProLint serves as a stand-alone program. It is easy to install and set up and the code
        will be made freely available on GitHub. Interested users can download the code and use the webserver
        locally.
        <br><br>
        ProLint as a webserver and webservice has <span style="color: black; font-weight: 900;">four</span> core objectives. These are listed below and
        explained in more detail in this section.

        <ol>
            <li>- &nbspPowerful and customizable analysis of protein-lipid contacts</li>
            <li>- &nbspModern and beautiful visualization</li>
            <li>- &nbspData sharing and accessibility</li>
            <li>- &nbspAutomation of protein-lipid contact generation</li>

        </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>Powerful and customizable analysis of protein-lipid contacts</h4>
    <p class="docp">
        Currently, the time it takes to analyze and interpret data usually exceeds the time
        to set up and perform MD Simulations. Add to this the
        continuing trend of increased system sizes, simulated for longer time scales and
        the need for a much bigger set of proteins, it becomes clear how analysis and
        visualization of protein-lipid contacts can become a significant bottleneck. It is worth noting here that
        the challenge is not large files in itself (i.e. the raw size of output files) as these can be usually trimmed
        down quite significantly without losing much information. Rather the challenge lies in the increasing
        complexity of the interaction networks involved in simulating more and more compositionally compolex systems.
        ProLint aims to bridge this gap between data generation and obtaining important insight on what is happening in the simulation.
        </p>

        <h4>Modern and beautiful visualization to gain quick insight</h4>
        <p class="docp">
        ProLint provides a fully-fledged visualization library that quickly and effortlessly displays
        protein-lipid interactions. It uses modern visualization libraries like
        <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh" target="_blank">Bokeh</a><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"> </i>,
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3" target="_blank">D3.js</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>,
        <a href="https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl" target="_blank">NGL Viewer</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js" target="_blank">Three.js</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
        in the background. The set of visualization applications that are
        supported by ProLint are distinct in the sense that each one offers a different insight into
        the calculated interaction network between lipids and proteins.
        </p>


        <h4>Data sharing and accessibility</h4>
        <p class="docp">
        Scientific journals usually have rigid restrictions on the number and type of graphical elements allowed and
        researchers must try to limit themselves to only what they believe to be the most relevant details of their work.
        This leads to an inefficient and incomplete presentation of the experiments and/or simulations performed and
        unintentional bias in only presenting positive and confirming results.
        Obtaining the original data that was used in published works is also a significant challenge.
        ProLint allows for contact information to be extracted from simulated systems and stored
        in small files that can be easily downloaded and shared and made publicly available.
        </p>


        <h4>Automation of protein-lipid contact generation</h4>
        <p class="docp">
        Following the trend in lipid-protein interactions, it is clear that it will become increasingly important to automate the generation of protein-lipid contacts for
        any arbitrary protein. Such tools will allow us to study how membrane proteins interact with their lipid environment and elucidate the importance of lipids
        in regulating and/or modulating the activity of embedded membrane proteins. Developing such automation protocols is an essential step in creating lipid-protein
        interaction databases - which will be the next major step in the field.
        ProLint is a perfectly suited tool that can be used as part of such automation pipelines.
